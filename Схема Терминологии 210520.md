Также в consistency theory
a class of social psychological theory holding that people are chiefly motivated by a desire to maintain congruence or consistency among their cognitions. Originally introduced by Fritz Heider, Leon Festinger, and others, consistency theory was first applied specifically to work behavior by Abraham K. Korman (1933–  ) in 1970. Korman’s theory is based on a two-point premise: a balance notion and a self-image standard. The theory states that workers will engage in, and find satisfying, behaviors that maximize their sense of cognitive balance and will be motivated to perform in a manner consistent with their self-image. Also called self-consistency theory. See consistency motive; self-verification motive.

Также в Theory of planned behavior:
a model that resembles the theory of reasoned action but also incorporates the construct of perceived behavioral control. Perceived behavioral control is added to attitude toward behavior and subjective norms as the antecedents influencing both the intention to perform a behavior and the performance of the behavior itself. [originally proposed by U.S. social psychologist Icek Ajzen (1942–  )]

## <a id="ambivalence"></a> Ambivalence
ambivalence
n.
1. the simultaneous existence of contradictory feelings and attitudes, such as pleasantness and unpleasantness or friendliness and hostility, toward the same person, object, event, or situation.

https://dictionary.apa.org/ambivalence
Применимо также в «Ambivalence of an attitude»:
the extent to which the evaluative responses associated with an attitude are inconsistent with one another. If the responses are uniformly positive or uniformly negative, ambivalence is low. If both positive and negative responses are associated with the attitude, ambivalence is high. See also affective–cognitive consistency; affective–evaluative consistency; cognitive–evaluative consistency; cross-dimension attitude consistency; within-dimension attitude consistency.

См. Attitude strength:
